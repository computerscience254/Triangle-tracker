## Triangle tracker project
Triangle tracker application prompts the enter the length values of the three sides of a triangle.
After submitting the values, triangle tracker takes the lengths of three sides and determines if they form a valid triangle. It determines whether it's an isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NO triangle at all.

##  Project requirements
1. For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
2. For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.
3. For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
4. Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values. (For example, the values 9,4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.)

## BDD specifications
#### User inputs
From the user inputs, the Triangle tracker:
* Determines if 3 sides create a valid triangle.
* Determines if 3 sides make an Equilateral triangle.
* Determines if 3 sides make an Isosceles triangle. 
* Determines if 3 sides make a Scalene triangle. 
#### Result
* Displays the triangle type for a valid triangle inputs.

or

* Displays Not a triangle at all for non-valid triangle entries.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

These are the softwares needed to execute the project: 

* IDEs include either: Atom, VS Code, Brackets.
* Browsers include either: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox.
* Operating System either: Linux Operating System, Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows.

## Installing

You can now install Atom using apt-get (or apt on Ubuntu):

Install Atom

```sudo apt-get install atom```

Install Atom Beta

```sudo apt-get install atom-beta```

Alternatively, you can download the Atom .deb package and install it directly:

Install Atom

```sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb```

Install Atom's dependencies if they are missing

```sudo apt-get -f install```

## How to view the Dan's Portfolio
